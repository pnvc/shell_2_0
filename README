This is my version of shell for Linux.
This is not serious shell, this is my shell.
I am creating him as some task from book A.V. Stolyarov "Vvedenie v programmirovanie chast 2".
I just learn git+remote repository with this thing :)

I use gcc compiler and gdb debugger.
For launch this program u need 5 steps (without one module for now) if you want try it with Linux:
1. You need Linux (or virtual machine)
2. You need gcc compiler
3. You need linker (ld) or no :)
4. You need make a command in directory with this program:
	gcc -Wall -g shell_2_0.c modules/input_formatting.c modules/help_functions.c -o execute_file

	Or you can create objects file and then link them with the help gcc again (without ld):
		gcc -Wall -g -c shell_2_0.c
		gcc -Wall -g -c modules/input_formatting.c
		gcc -Wall -g -c modules/help_functions.c
		gcc shell_2_0.o modules/input_formatting.o modules/help_functions.o -o execute_file
	flag -Wall for errors
	flag -g for debugger
	So you can make commands without them if you want :)
5. Then you can execute execute_file :)

I will change README file when I gonna write new modules :)

In code I use many comments, I know it, I need it now.
